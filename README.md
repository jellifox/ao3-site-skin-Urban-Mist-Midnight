🌫️ Urban mist & midnight

This is a two-layered AO3 site skin setup designed for users who want an elegant dark mode (midnight) built on top of a soft neutral base (mist). You can use either skin on its own, or stack them using AO3’s parent skin feature to modularly toggle enhancements.

✨ What They Do
	•	mist: A soft, minimal light mode with gentle background colors, simplified borders, and subtle pastel accents. Intended as a stable base skin.
	•	midnight: A high-contrast dark mode layer that overrides mist, designed to work as a child skin. It brings deep backgrounds, lighter text, and improved readability in low-light settings.

midnight assumes mist as its parent. It does not work standalone.
